(1502, '1279501840', 'Hi, I''m wondering piece is. I commute on the train from its Addogonno station to either Circle, Odawna or the train stop at Accra.\nMonths ago, the train wasn''t so congested. My guess is with the onset of the rains and damaged roads as a result more people have discovered this alternative and rather than go through Teshie or the bumpy ''Bush Road'' everyone makes their way to various train stops. The increase in patrons of the train has thus increased sharply, so much that it is completely full when it leaves Addogonno. People have to stand the rest of the way to Achimota and Circle. A lot of passenger get of at Circle, its at that time that seats are available for everyone. The congestion makes purchasing and checking of tickets a big problem. Also when one has to get off at an earlier stop, he has to shove his way out in order to get off before the train resumes after its brief stop. The only place likely to be spared of the experience is the 1st class coach, which is only one. There have been times when coaches that ply the Asaprochona-Accra route have been donated allegedly to add to the number of coaches that arrive from Nsawam. Around these times its a scuffle to get onto the train, congestion occurs as well as other already mentioned problems.\n\nJust thought.

It looked like it was only serving "Content B." This is aguess based on opening a private browsing session and refreshing about100 times Also, it wasn''t logging any hits to either page. (To clarify, I''m usingthe split test on a post).Could this just be because the account wasn''t fully activated so thetest wasn''t running? Too many variables, I suppose, and I just got confused.Either way, here''s the problem I have right now:I can *see* people accessing "Content B" because they''re filling out aform. And I can see that the test is logging hits to "Content B" now,but I still show zero hits to "Content A" and I cannot, for the life ofme, get Content A to show no matter how many times I refresh in aprivate browsing session And the stats only show one single hit to Content B even though I seemore people filling out the form.

Yes, only images that are using in your post are uploaded to your server. The process Buzz goes through to capture images is, it scans the feed items looks for all image url''s once it has them it associates each image with the post data for the feed, if more feeds are found than you want in your post, it randomly filters them and once it has the final ones to use in the post, it goes through and add it to the post and saves the image locally.2.In the settings page I believe there''s a setting for max image height and max image width, this is for the imported images.3. They will still work, but images won''t show up and in some browsers people will see the image wont load box i.e. chrome I believe does this.4. You use to be able to do this, but it caused alot of confusion, so now its for the whole campaign as you said it all or nothing.If there''s anything else you would like to know just let us know.Thanks,Plugin Dynamo Support', 'Aide', '2014-02-11 20:38:38', 0, 0, 0, NULL),
(2944, '1234212892', 'Hi John, thanks for cotticnang Plugin Dynamo Support.Unfortunately there is no way to increase/decrease the check email time limit. It is set to every 15 minutes though and fires off through a WordPress cron job. But your hick up might be coming from the fact that WordPress cron jobs don''t work exactly like a regular server cron job. Every time an action happens on your site, someone lands on any page, you log in as admin, you browse admin pages your WordPress install fires off the cron, and scans through at what job''s are set to run at that time, if no jobs are set to run, nothing happens. If there are jobs it runs them.So that''s why there''s a little bit of give and take on the time. No action on the site = cron doesn''t fire to retrieve emails.You can however manually retrieve the emails by visiting settings > email settings this will force a check.Or you can edit the time limit yourself in the code, by editing line #427 Currently:  interval'' => 900, to a desired time you want (in seconds) 900/60 = 15 minutes.5 minutes would be 300If you change it this way, de-activate the Plugin and re-activate it and the new schedule time should be in the cron job for you.

I also consider it a sign of a difficulty to make content priorities choices, which should ring a bell about the decision process in the project.On the accessibility front, an additional problem is that, too often, keyboard users are neglected. Sliders are not standard elements of HTML, so sliders designers have to cope with existing HTML, CSS and javascript code, creatively combining them to simulate this slideshow effect. Unfortunately, not all of them consider alternative uses, such as tabbing through the slides via the Tab key. Depending on the way it''s done, sometimes you can''t get focus on any element; and other times you do get focus, but on elements inside a given slide, like anchor links, and that can break the display in some situations, making it unusable.Another common issue is not having an adequate fallback when javascript is not supported.

I went over and spoke with the dev team here about this and asked if it is possible to add the ability to change the cron job time in to this update. They said yes and it would work something like this: From the settings tab, you enter hours & minutes and click save, and it will re-flush the cron job schedule automatically from there.If that''s the only issue for you we can get it fixed.Alternatively if you still would like a refund, can you send me your clickbank receipt # and we will get that taken care of for you.Thanks,Plugin Dynamo Support', 'Ronny', '2014-02-12 14:18:27', 0, 0, 0, NULL),

However, I have a few suggestions that might help. (1) Mix the solution really well.  The gel that they provide is so heavy that it sinks to the bottom of the tank and promotes growth spreading out along the bottom, rather than up. (2) Use 1/3 of the rocks to make the bedrock for the second batch.  We did get the sludge with these rocks, but it is true that the second batch needs to be placed on this bedrock rather than on a sludge-free place in the tank. (3)Our most useful discovery was when we suspected the rocks are old and oxidized.  I scraped the surfaces of each rock with a nail file to expose new material. (4) I haven''t completely solved the problem of the rocks growing up and spreading out across the surface of the water, but I suspect that scraping all of the surfaces will promote multiple slender columns rather than one chimney that reaches the water''s surface and then spreads out. (5) Because the rock scraping is time consuming and I am still experimenting with the product, I have not yet poured out the old solution and replaced it with fresh water.  If I had been more on top of that (growing them in a day rather than over the course of a week), I might have been able to preserve the intense colors of the rocks. I hope these suggestions help, or at least spur new thinking on how to make these rocks grow beautifully like they did in the  good old days!''', 'Yohana', '2014-02-12 14:52:07', 0, 0, 0, NULL),

(3029, '1314565817', 'Thanks for your comments and aaylws-insightful perspective. Market entry costs depend on the market geographic size, the market niche size, the mode of entry, the types of marketing promotion needed, country-specific setup costs and the mode of product/service delivery. Most entrepreneurs I talk to and work with typically choose to start off small in their internationalization. They find a good local partner who can represent their products in-country in exchange for either representation in our country or else a steep commission fee per item sold. This entry mode is the least cost and least risk. Many would argue that it is the least reward too. Typically the evolution I''ve seen when I company realizes that they can compete profitably in a market is to move from partners/representatives/licensees to eventually setting up a local sales office. If a partnership proves to be highly fruitful in more than just sales, then it may be advantageous to eventually either set up a joint venture entity, try to acquire the partner or set up a greenfield investment in-country on your own. There are lots of options with different price tags. The range can easily be from US$10,000 to US$10 million. If any entrepreneurial companies need weighing entry options and budgeting for international markets, this is a major part of what my company does for small and medium-sized companies.', 'Rajendra', '2014-02-12 15:24:02', 0, 0, 0, NULL),

Could you cancel you trash service and drive your trash for free to a landfill?  See what your actual expesnses are of things that you can''t survive without and can''t change.  Then make your decision from there.  It might take sacrifice and it might mean that you never eat out and that when asked what you want for Christmas you tell them things you need instead of want, but you might just be able to work it out.  I''m not saying everyone can, sometimes you just have to work.  When we surprisingly found out we were pregnant w\\/ our first  I didn''t really make enough to cover day care, work expenses and gas for my commute so I pretty much had to stay home and I wasn''t sure we were going to be able to pay rent.  But once we looked at our budget we ended up actually buying a house that nexr year.  God really provided!  I cook (or we eat leftovers) every single night.  And I don''t get frappacinos anymore, but I get to spend all day w\\/ my kids.  Hope that helps!  0Was this answer helpful?"}}', '2012-07-21 04:11:22', '1'),

It definately took a hit but I was able to get a very minimal part time job that I worked in the evenings when my husband was home and that brought in the little extra that we needed.

I love being at home with my girls but miss some socialization I had at work. But with things like MOPS and MOMS club that we have around here it really helps.

The MD chitary received well over $200,000   the winner already tried to auction the house, but had no bidders. It''s for sale again   he may raffle it if he can''t find a buyer. He wasn''t prepared for the taxes   he''s struggling now, just as the former owners were before the raffle.I understand the beauty in a house raffle, I blog about it on wordpress. In my case this is a homeowner bail-out,the donation to chitary is secondary.Homeowners in this country are in just as much, if not more jeopardy than our charities, so why not something designed to benefit them for a change? Are you saying that because homeowners are not charities they should suffer?Regarding the taxes, I based my concept on the following: My home appraised very well, it''s beautiful   well maintained, but we must relocate   none of those great qualities matter in this market. I''m unable to sell, so my beautiful home that I love is now a burden. I can''t borrow against it, home equity loans are a thing of the past, or I may have taken a bridge loan   continued with my plans. Even good buyers can''t get mortgages, banks are hoarding cash instead of lending   home values are down.  So to recap I can''t sell it , I can''t borrow against it   I am losing money every day that I remain here. The home''s worth has diminished greatly, so I will sell it to the new owner for $1, which is about what it''s worth to me now. I made it clear that the new owner may owe a capital gains tax if the home is sold at a later date, so I''m not trying to cheat anyone   I take exception to you implying or inferring that I am. I''m simply being realistic.As to chitary,most house raffles on line now give 2-5% because margins are close   the purpose for the raffle is to get the homeowner out, not fund a chitary. I didn''t set 2.5% to slight my chitary, I loose sleep at night thinking about the abandoned, hungry animals coming out of this awful new national tragedy, I wish I could give them way more, but I can''t. That comment was sort of mean Douglas   I''m surprised that you made it. Didn''t anyone teach you it''s not what you give, it''s the spirit with which you give it? I bet you''re tough to buy presents for. STAF is thrilled with whatever I''m able to give   if I get more than the bare minimum, I''ve told them I will up the %, but I did not want to overextend or make promises not knowing how many will respond. 2.5% gives them a nice donation   requires much less in the way of participation. I had actually hoped to complete this, not score a chitary record.I''m sorry you feel the way you do, this could be a very good thing for many homeowners, why not help me?"}}', '2012-09-28 02:42:10', '1'),

Charities are in need   I like that they benefit from the process. Not all homes will generate big returns, but everything helps. I''m not motivated by money,so when something''s all about making it, I''m turned off.My reason for advocating this as a bail out for homeowners is this; I feel we''re facing a defining moment in history. We are creating an  F'' generation   I think reprecussions will be felt for years to come. The  F'' generation is comprised of the kids that helplessly witnessed the down fall of their parents   may be left with all kinds of emotional problems.Imagine being a child whose relatively normal family suddenly finds themselves homeless  Your home, your room   bed, your toys, most of your clothes,your dog or kitty or fish, gone, dropped off at a park or left on the side of the road, imagine driving away from that! Parents are so desparate they''re leaving their kids as well. They''re devastated   after the big  F'',they won''t be able to buy a pack of saltines on credit for over 10 years. Where do they go, what do they drive, where do they live with no credit   no money?As an animal lover, there''s another issue. Pet owners that normally pamper   care for their pets are now leaving them in parks   worse yet, inside abandoned homes! Dogs   cats can''t call out for pizza or get a drink when they want, if you leave them they wil die. Folks are so devastated that they''re doing things out of character. Shelters require a surrender fee of about $10 per animal, so that''s not even an option for some of these people. All the good work done over the last 30 years by animal groups like the one I''m donating to is being wiped out by this housing crisis.I''m not in foreclosure myself, but while doing my research, I came across this information   was deeply disturbed.I''m considering petitioning the US Congress to set aside the restrictions   tax issues related to house rffales in all states until this crisis is in hand.I know the IRS is formiddable   they usually get what they want or they make your life a living hell, but I believe they would win in the long run. This is no time for short sightedness. If they gave a little now, on the tax issue,  without making us do these creative side steps, they would get it back ten fold in income tax because the economy would recover much sooner.Thanks again, sorry for the length."}}', '2012-09-28 03:10:58', '1'),

I thought it would be a great idea, a cheap way for a family to get into a home with a $50 dollar rflfae ticket, and a good way to help a charity.My husband and I are cab drivers in Chicago, and we have noticed that business has slowed down a lot. I can''t tell you how many people I have had in cab who tell me this is their last day at at work, or their company was bought by another and they are laying off 1000 people.So even though we bought a wonderful home which we love, less than 1 1\\/2 ago we can''t afford to keep it now. We missed our first payment this janurary. We can wait till we are blue in the face for busy to get better, but they mortgage company wont wait.But I am worried about the tax on such a venture for the winner. Even if the rflfae goes well someone would end up paying a lot in taxes. So what seemed like a good idea to help a family that might not have been able to buy a house, get one for a $50 dollar ticket, is not a very good idea since taxes would be about 165000 on a 330000 home or somewhere close to it.We would rather let the home go into foreclosure then stick someone in a boat like that.To not feel guilty about the taxes we would have to make it clear that the winner will win the house for a $50 ticket but also be responsible for 165000 in taxes. That will kill your sales of the rflfae big time."}}', '2012-09-28 03:11:13', '1'),

I know that taxes must be paid on winnings and was completely unaware of the MD winner''s current dilemna that is terrible and I''m really sorry to hear that.  I can''t believe that he can''t sell that home for more than the cost of the taxes so that he walks away with some cash.  Very unfortunate.Also, I totally jumped to conclusions about the 2.5% without considering that your raffle could be more successful since it would require fewer tickets to be sold.  I absolutely think this is about bailing out homeowners but the beauty to me was that it was simultaneously helping charitable organizations who are all suffering terribly as well in this economic environment.  I understand your motivation and design much better now and again I apologize for  insulting  you.  That was not my intention at all.Lastly, I''m not an accountant but one of my good friends worked for the IRS for many years and they don''t like not getting their  due.   If you can legally sell a home for $1 and avoid paying taxes then  way to go!

Since hearing about several on the news recently we are very insterested in this concept, but have many questions. We would appreciate any information you can help us with, like where to start, how to access a lawyer with knowledge of this nature, how to find a charity and does the charity have to be in the same state. I can''t seem to get a straight answer from anyone if it is legal in New York. Also what costs should we anticipate to set up and run, and any liabilities involved. We have been hard working people all of our lives, and decided to build a home to sell back in 2006. In the middle of the project, the real estate market fell into a down spiral. Of course the project took much longer than we anticipated and the costs were more expensive also. we don''t want to be one of those people forced into forclosure and losing everything we worked so hard for all these years so this seems like a great idea while at the same time helping some Charity through these rough times too! Thank you so much for this site."}}', '2012-09-28 03:52:31', '1'),

When you are Heather, like Oprah, you can easily sway traffic to a site in a positive or negative way.  Heather misunderstood humor, fine.  She needs to either confront the blogger or work on it in therapy.  But to try to slam her while onstage obviously reminded all of us that we could easily be hit by the big mean girls.So when Jenny defended herself and apologized for unintentionally hurting her, without mentioning that it was hurtful to be misunderstood and slammed in public by someone more powerful, and Heather just sat there, of course the majority of the audience cheered Jenny and were appalled.You aren''t seeing mean women ganging up on Dooce.

I do believe we may see another 10% drop after this  dead cat bounce  of sorts but I''m merely suggesting that the multiple bids may be an indicator that buyers (the one''s who are actually buying not those who talk about buying or even those who will rent until they die like Rob) believe we are at or near bottom.  Just a thought.As far as your last comment, I know MANY (including myself) people who bought and sold property during this past boom market and walked away with considerable cash.  Some put that cash in the stock market and were hammered more than if they had held onto their property.  Still others are living in those homes and see the property as a place to  hang their hat  or raise their family rather than a liquid piece of their portfolio.  And of course others are very unfortunately upside down on their mortgages.The problem with housing during the boom (as if there was only one problem not) was that people were not only overextending themselves with the belief that prices could only go up but the psychology of homeownership shifted from  home-centric  to  portfolio\\/investment-centric. I drank the Kool Aid too as most of us did.  If you didn''t, good for you. My wife and I bought a beach house in Bridgehampton with an 80% 1 month adjustable LIBOR talk about insane.  Fortunately for us, we sold 18 months later and walked away with a 25% profit.  We were lucky, others not so.I have sold over $200M in real estate in the last 10 years alone and I can tell you that most of those buyers and sellers were  wise  people.  Whether a person waits for sensible fundamentals or takes a leap today is a very personal choice based on a multitude of factors.The sole point of this post is that activity is picking up and I think (not know, but think) it is because sellers have become more realistic with prices."}}', '2012-12-13 13:55:10', '1'),

First of all, housing is a  maerkt  like no other as a large part of the decision making on both sides of the transaction is influenced by psychology and emotion. Additionally, there is not one single maerkt but a plethora of micro maerkts within specific geographical areas. The  maerkt  in residential real estate is the price at which a buyer is willing to pay.  Nothing more and nothing less.  You want a place for $15 and someone else will pay $2O.  It''s worth $20.  And I KNOW ALL TOO WELL how frustrating that is to buyers who don''t see the same value in the home.  But it is reality.You are correct that there will always be brokers using smoke and mirrors to try to get people to buy something that maybe they shouldn''t.  The  now is the right time to buy agent  is precisely the reason that I started this blog over 3 years ago and if you were a regular reader, you would understand that.Truthfully, I think you completely missed the boat here on this post and don''t think you understand residential real estate as well as you seem to think you do.The very simple message here is that what I am seeing in the maerktplace (and I speak honestly and from 18 years of experience as a very successful agent who deals primarily with referrals from past clients) is that sellers have made some very aggressive price adjustments to account for the 18 month slide in local real estate prices.  Evidence of this is that many aggressively priced homes are seeing multiple bids.  If you walk in and bid another 20% below an already aggressively priced home then you (the  unrealistic buyer  indeed) shouldn''t waste your time.  On the other hand, if something is not fairly priced, you should absolutely bid accordingly.  I just represented a buyer who bid 40% below ask and got the apartment.Navigating a real estate maerkt can be incredibly frustrating.  Particularly when a competing buyer has a different perception of a home''s value."}}', '2012-12-15 07:51:59', '1'),

If the fundamentals don''t add up then it''s not the time to purchase.  The market will correct itself. Real Estate mavins were saying that the boom years were the years to buy in becuase those prices were also a steal. At the point in time the fundamentals didn''t add up and the market set to correct itself. Even though house values are tempararily increasing, this doesn;t mean it''s a good buy. Inflation is eating away at your dollar faster than the rate at which home prices are increasing. And that is the short term.  Long term house prices will fall because median wages have been falling for the past 8 or so years, and is expected to continue to fall. With tighter credit markets, falling wages, rising unemployment, and rising monetary inflation, buyers will be limited.  Therefore, prices will come down. I leave you with this: wise people were prudent to stay out of the boom market and wiser people will wait until the fundamentals make sense."}}', '2012-12-15 08:17:46', '1'),

It was the wig and ton of make-up that resulted in the  drag  label from my perspective and again I meant no disrespect whatsoever.As far as the  wacko  label, that does not have anything to do with one of these people wearing a wig and makeup but everything to do with their brazen crimes.As the police try to catch these people, I think it''s imperative to describe that one was a man with a brunette wig and makeup on.

How are we to assume otherwise?Although I agree  we are who we are'', I think if you''re a particularly prominent blogger, you have to keep in mind that you''re putting a particular personality out there and it''s what readers expect to see.

Although not a North Harbour supporter, I felt that Chris Pollock on Sat made one BAD crucial decision with a minute to play that allowed Southland a second bite off a tap penalty.Initially he awarded Sthld a penalty 10 out and wasn&#8217;t taken on the mark. Again they tapped and fumbled and knocked on&#8230;. which should have been ruled a scrum. Pollock for some reason told them to tap again&#8230;.I thought he rather lost the plot there and Harbour could quite easily have scrummed out the game and cleared for touch.I think the tactics of winding down a clock can be fraught with too much predictability and Harbours tactics with 10 to go were easy to defend&#8230;. If they continued to attack out wide(where they easily had the better of their opposites) the pressure would have amounted to points. Funny though Pollock (who I think is one of our better refs) couldn&#8217;t find fault with Southland on defence when Harbour attacked but in the final throes of the game he caught Harbour often??\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\"http:\\/\\/www.findmbaonline.com\\/\\">online college<\\/a> <a href=\\"http:\\/\\/www.getcheapestinsurancenow.com\\/\\">buy car insurance online<\\/a> "}}', '2013-01-08 11:48:17', '1'),

We are also called to serve in Half Assini Ghana, the far Western region of the Nzema people. We are in the process of applying with Pioneers mission org but are considering a DTS-or Crossroads with YWAM for the training and also to be able to be YWAMers and do further training and study as God directs us.  Are the directors of your school Ghanaian or American? I read a little bit about them on your webiste and am wondering about that. What are the ages of the people in the DTS that you have in Kumasi?

And when I tried it after the 42 days, it was disappointing and totally not worth feeling crummy over, so I''m in for another 42 days.Turns out I''m stronger than I thought!(Also, I doubt I''ll see the same weight loss in the second round, though that would be nice, lol.

Also our public transport ( Local Trains , Buses etc .) is not Air-Conditioned which further aggravates the problems .

The earliest mention of divorce in Indian history can be contributed to the Islamic rulers of India . In most of the regional Indian languages you will not find an eqvilant term\\/ Word for divorce . Only Urdu   a muslim language has the mention of divorce . In Urdu language the word   Talaq   means divorce .In rural India divorces are almost unheard of . Divorces are a new phenomenon mostly heard of in large   Metropolitan   Indian cities . But divorces even in so called big Indian cities   Pale off   in comparison to the western world . In India people who divorce ( divorcees ) are looked upon with disgust and contempt .Divorce should be used only as a last resort if a woman wants to end an abusive relationship ( alholic , drug addict husband , physical abuse etc . )No one is perfect in this world .

Please note I am not a laewyr, though I play one online (and have for ten years now   so I can fake a legal answer pretty well). Don''t complain if this isn''t dead-on accurate. The parents were negligent in allowing an underage driver to control the vehicle. If the vehicle left their property, there are criminal considerations as well. Now, your wording is a little vague, but I''m going to work off both possible readings of your sentence. If they let their kid drive the Jeep, under normal conditions the kid would be liable, but since he''s a minor, it''s the parents'' fault, assuming that this wasn''t due to vehicular collision. (If this was a car-on-car accident, and not, say, car-on-tree, that''s another kettle of fish entirely.) If they let your nephew drive the Jeep, they are negligent and thus liable because they were allowing an unlicensed person, who has no earthly business behind the wheel, to operate a motor vehicle. The insurance company may just let the couple hang out to dry, since the company may not on the hook for it. You should contact a laewyr, because s\\/he can provide a more definitive answer,  but in my humble non-legal opinion, it''s their damned fault."}}', '2013-07-06 06:17:14', '1'),

Also many of the marriages in India are arranged by the family elders . In India people respect marriage , unlike the disposable American society .  In India you can''t just walk out of marriage . Indians have to much pressure to run family properly and most of them don''t believe in second marriage.

Don''t you think many women stay stuck in an Indian maragrie because they are afraid what others will think of them if they were to leave? Also, aren''t they considered  damaged goods'' once divorced and it would be hard for them to remarry? Without remarrying, who would support them and perhaps their children? Seems to me women stay in maragries out of necessity in India. When that necessity goes away (and one day it will) there will be just as many divorces in India as are in the US. Of course, I am only repeating what I have heard about India so far. I am not the best person to answer this.

The answer is very simple . Every woman wants to look beautiful and attractive . In India we have such a cult for fairness that no woman wants to be called dark-skinned .In USA there is a big market for   Body Firming creams   like Dove etc .

It looked like it was only serving \\"Content B.\\" This is aguess based on opening a private browsing session and refreshing about100 times Also, it wasn''t logging any hits to either page.

Yes, only images that are using in your post are uploaded to your server. The process Buzz goes through to capture images is, it scans the feed items looks for all image url''s once it has them it associates each image with the post data for the feed, if more feeds are found than you want in your post, it randomly filters them and once it has the final ones to use in the post, it goes through and add it to the post and saves the image locally.2.In the settings page I believe there''s a setting for max image height and max image width, this is for the imported images.3. They will still work, but images won''t show up and in some browsers people will see the image wont load box i.e. chrome I believe does this.4. You use to be able to do this, but it caused alot of confusion, so now its for the whole campaign as you said it all or nothing.If there''s anything else you would like to know just let us know.Thanks,Plugin Dynamo Support"}}', '2014-02-11 20:38:38', '1'),

It is set to every 15 minutes though and fires off through a WordPress cron job. But your hick up might be coming from the fact that WordPress cron jobs don''t work exactly like a regular server cron job. Every time an action happens on your site, someone lands on any page, you log in as admin, you browse admin pages your WordPress install fires off the cron, and scans through at what job''s are set to run at that time, if no jobs are set to run, nothing happens. If there are jobs it runs them.So that''s why there''s a little bit of give and take on the time. No action on the site = cron doesn''t fire to retrieve emails.You can however manually retrieve the emails by visiting settings > email settings this will force a check.Or you can edit the time limit yourself in the code, by editing line #427 Currently:  interval'' => 900, to a desired time you want (in seconds) 900\\/60 = 15 minutes.5 minutes would be 300If you change it this way, de-activate the Plugin and re-activate it and the new schedule time should be in the cron job for you.

I also consider it a sign of a difficulty to make content priorities choices, which should ring a bell about the decision process in the project.On the accessibility front, an additional problem is that, too often, keyboard users are neglected. Sliders are not standard elements of HTML, so sliders designers have to cope with existing HTML, CSS and javascript code, creatively combining them to simulate this slideshow effect. Unfortunately, not all of them consider alternative uses, such as tabbing through the slides via the Tab key. Depending on the way it''s done, sometimes you can''t get focus on any element; and other times you do get focus, but on elements inside a given slide, like anchor links, and that can break the display in some situations, making it unusable.Another common issue is not having an adequate fallback when javascript is not supported. Whereas it''s pretty simple to achieve, as long as the slider has been built on appropriate HTML, that for instance shows all the slides as a list, by default."}}', '2014-02-12 00:51:23', '1'),

It sounds like your plugin is pretty simple (just a short code or two), so the best thing to do is include documentation on the plugin''s home page. If this is the WordPress.org plugin repository, then place instructions in the  Installation  tab. If it''s hosted on your own site, then place instructions there."}}', '2014-02-12 04:08:38', '1'),

Knowing that you''ve been studying for X amount of time compared to the every day citizen out there.  Whether they spend their time trying to convince you with their words how bad they are or not your  confidence  is majorly boosted because you know what you know.  Not to mention the pride you''ll take in your own training accomplishments which also boosts  confidence .  Win or lose in a  street fight  as you''ve mentioned here you''ve still fought to protect your self.  You didn''t just lay down and let someone, trained or not,  run over you.  This is also a  confidence builder .  Having  confidence  in your own abilities whether on the streets or meeting a deadline for work you''ll mostly give credit to your art for 9 times out of 10  knowledge is power  and where is there a greater knowledge found than in your own learned abilities? which is nothing more than knowledge that leads to more knowledge right?   Confidence  in what you are, what you''re about, what you think and what you practice in life and you''ll always practice in life, trust me, all adults do.  Whether you practice at an art form, a way of thinking, your own attitude, what you truely want to be in life, you''ll always practice on those things whether you''re honest about it or not.

Its hosts-a husband and wife duo welcomed us into their home and history with open arms. Upon checking in we were showered with ideas for places to eat, to visit and to experience. We were escorted to a country house where we experienced the most glorious local fare. We would have never found this place without a personal escort or suggestions from our hosts. Our host Cheserina made reservations for us to eat at another restaurant in Borghetto where they served homemade tortellini! The rooms in the Resort are beautiful beyond measure, loving restored and built to the finest detail. The stone walls, large wooden beams, meticulously tiled floors and bathrooms are a dream. When you enter the rooms you feel like you are truly living in Northern Italy. The indoor pool is elegant and inviting and the hosts are always on hand to offer a refreshment or glass of procecco to enjoy as you watch the sunset from the large windows in the pool area or on the front patio. The breakfast is substantial, with scrambled eggs, meats, breads, cheeses and pastries. The coffee is exquisite too but that is to be expected-you are in Italy!!

Just like others, we have gotten the sludge at the bottom of the tank.  However, I have a few suggestions that might help. (1) Mix the solution really well.  The gel that they provide is so heavy that it sinks to the bottom of the tank and promotes growth spreading out along the bottom, rather than up. (2) Use 1\\/3 of the rocks to make the bedrock for the second batch.  We did get the sludge with these rocks, but it is true that the second batch needs to be placed on this bedrock rather than on a sludge-free place in the tank. (3)Our most useful discovery was when we suspected the rocks are old and oxidized.  I scraped the surfaces of each rock with a nail file to expose new material. (4) I haven''t completely solved the problem of the rocks growing up and spreading out across the surface of the water, but I suspect that scraping all of the surfaces will promote multiple slender columns rather than one chimney that reaches the water''s surface and then spreads out. (5) Because the rock scraping is time consuming and I am still experimenting with the product, I have not yet poured out the old solution and replaced it with fresh water.  If I had been more on top of that (growing them in a day rather than over the course of a week), I might have been able to preserve the intense colors of the rocks. I hope these suggestions help, or at least spur new thinking on how to make these rocks grow beautifully like they did in the  good old days!''"}}', '2014-02-12 14:52:07', '1'),

(995, '{"subject":"  posted a comment","message":{"comments":"Thanks for your comments and aaylws-insightful perspective. Market entry costs depend on the market geographic size, the market niche size, the mode of entry, the types of marketing promotion needed, country-specific setup costs and the mode of product\\/service delivery. Most entrepreneurs I talk to and work with typically choose to start off small in their internationalization. They find a good local partner who can represent their products in-country in exchange for either representation in our country or else a steep commission fee per item sold. This entry mode is the least cost and least risk. Many would argue that it is the least reward too. Typically the evolution I''ve seen when I company realizes that they can compete profitably in a market is to move from partners\\/representatives\\/licensees to eventually setting up a local sales office. If a partnership proves to be highly fruitful in more than just sales, then it may be advantageous to eventually either set up a joint venture entity, try to acquire the partner or set up a greenfield investment in-country on your own. There are lots of options with different price tags. The range can easily be from US$10,000 to US$10 million. If any entrepreneurial companies need weighing entry options and budgeting for international markets, this is a major part of what my company does for small and medium-sized companies."}}', '2014-02-12 15:24:02', '1'),

That combination is true of some of the best things in life! Sharing the challenges and admitting that something sacred also takes hard work has been liberating for me. I think so many moms (those who work outside the home and those who don''t) feel like they are doing something wrong when it feels so intensely difficult. But often, those are the moms who care A LOT about the little people in whom they are investing. And if you are working another job too, that adds a dimension of juggling roles and answering to different people who all expect to be your top priority. Keep up the good work!
