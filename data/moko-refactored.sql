(1502, 2107, 'Hi, I''m wondering piece is. I commute on the train from its Addogonno station to either Circle, Odawna or the train stop at Accra.\nMonths ago, the train wasn''t so congested. My guess is with the onset of the rains and damaged roads as a result more people have discovered this alternative and rather than go through Teshie or the bumpy ''Bush Road'' everyone makes their way to various train stops. The increase in patrons of the train has thus increased sharply, so much that it is completely full when it leaves Addogonno. People have to stand the rest of the way to Achimota and Circle. A lot of passenger get of at Circle, its at that time that seats are available for everyone. The congestion makes purchasing and checking of tickets a big problem. Also when one has to get off at an earlier stop, he has to shove his way out in order to get off before the train resumes after its brief stop. The only place likely to be spared of the experience is the 1st class coach, which is only one. There have been times when coaches that ply the Asaprochona-Accra route have been donated allegedly to add to the number of coaches that arrive from Nsawam. Around these times its a scuffle to get onto the train, congestion occurs as well as other already mentioned problems.\n\nJust thought.

What a shame for the children that the had such old and dangerous swings and slides.The slides were pieces of wood and if you didn''t land on your feet you would have broke your back. The roundabouts would hardly turn round. Yet they were full of  children. I pushed them  round with all my might. They smile  on their  face was well worth the effort. The entertainment was great. It was Christmas and all the children enjoyed themselves. Please John Atta Mills give the children  of Accra a park that they can play in.

Are the directors of your school Ghanaian or American? I read a little bit about them on your webiste and am wondering about that. What are the ages of the people in the DTS that you have in Kumasi?

Yes, only images that are using in your post are uploaded to your server. The process Buzz goes through to capture images is, it scans the feed items looks for all image url''s once it has them it associates each image with the post data for the feed, if more feeds are found than you want in your post, it randomly filters them and once it has the final ones to use in the post, it goes through and add it to the post and saves the image locally.2.In the settings page I believe there''s a setting for max image height and max image width, this is for the imported images.3. They will still work, but images won''t show up and in some browsers people will see the image wont load box i.e. chrome I believe does this.4.

(2944, 234, 'Hi John, thanks for cotticnang Plugin Dynamo Support.Unfortunately there is no way to increase/decrease the check email time limit. It is set to every 15 minutes though and fires off through a WordPress cron job. But your hick up might be coming from the fact that WordPress cron jobs don''t work exactly like a regular server cron job. Every time an action happens on your site, someone lands on any page, you log in as admin, you browse admin pages your WordPress install fires off the cron, and scans through at what job''s are set to run at that time, if no jobs are set to run, nothing happens. If there are jobs it runs them.So that''s why there''s a little bit of give and take on the time. No action on the site = cron doesn''t fire to retrieve emails.You can however manually retrieve the emails by visiting settings > email settings this will force a check.Or you can edit the time limit yourself in the code, by editing line #427 Currently:  interval'' => 900, to a desired time you want (in seconds) 900/60 = 15 minutes.5 minutes would be 300If you change it this way, de-activate the Plugin and re-activate it and the new schedule time should be in the cron job for you.

I also consider it a sign of a difficulty to make content priorities choices, which should ring a bell about the decision process in the project.On the accessibility front, an additional problem is that, too often, keyboard users are neglected. Sliders are not standard elements of HTML, so sliders designers have to cope with existing HTML, CSS and javascript code, creatively combining them to simulate this slideshow effect. Unfortunately, not all of them consider alternative uses, such as tabbing through the slides via the Tab key. Depending on the way it''s done, sometimes you can''t get focus on any element; and other times you do get focus, but on elements inside a given slide, like anchor links, and that can break the display in some situations, making it unusable.Another common issue is not having an adequate fallback when javascript is not supported. Whereas it''s pretty simple to achieve, as long as the slider has been built on appropriate HTML, that for instance shows all the slides as a list, by default.', 'Adwait', '2014-02-12 00:51:23', 0, 0, 0, NULL),

However, I have a few suggestions that might help. (1) Mix the solution really well.  The gel that they provide is so heavy that it sinks to the bottom of the tank and promotes growth spreading out along the bottom, rather than up. (2) Use 1/3 of the rocks to make the bedrock for the second batch.  We did get the sludge with these rocks, but it is true that the second batch needs to be placed on this bedrock rather than on a sludge-free place in the tank. (3)Our most useful discovery was when we suspected the rocks are old and oxidized.  I scraped the surfaces of each rock with a nail file to expose new material. (4) I haven''t completely solved the problem of the rocks growing up and spreading out across the surface of the water, but I suspect that scraping all of the surfaces will promote multiple slender columns rather than one chimney that reaches the water''s surface and then spreads out. (5) Because the rock scraping is time consuming and I am still experimenting with the product, I have not yet poured out the old solution and replaced it with fresh water.  If I had been more on top of that (growing them in a day rather than over the course of a week), I might have been able to preserve the intense colors of the rocks. I hope these suggestions help, or at least spur new thinking on how to make these rocks grow beautifully like they did in the  good old days!''', 'Yohana', '2014-02-12 14:52:07', 0, 0, 0, NULL),

(3029, 2699, 'Thanks for your comments and aaylws-insightful perspective. Market entry costs depend on the market geographic size, the market niche size, the mode of entry, the types of marketing promotion needed, country-specific setup costs and the mode of product/service delivery. Most entrepreneurs I talk to and work with typically choose to start off small in their internationalization. They find a good local partner who can represent their products in-country in exchange for either representation in our country or else a steep commission fee per item sold. This entry mode is the least cost and least risk. Many would argue that it is the least reward too. Typically the evolution I''ve seen when I company realizes that they can compete profitably in a market is to move from partners/representatives/licensees to eventually setting up a local sales office. If a partnership proves to be highly fruitful in more than just sales, then it may be advantageous to eventually either set up a joint venture entity, try to acquire the partner or set up a greenfield investment in-country on your own. There are lots of options with different price tags. The range can easily be from US$10,000 to US$10 million. If any entrepreneurial companies need weighing entry options and budgeting for international markets, this is a major part of what my company does for small and medium-sized companies.', 'Rajendra', '2014-02-12 15:24:02', 0, 0, 0, NULL),
